# Within python we have a series of data types that are common across most of
# the programming languages we have today
# they are as follows

# any numerical value without a decimal is called an integer
integerDataType= 1 
# any numerical value containing decimal points is called a float
floatDataType= 1.5 
# any characters contained within quotations is a string
stringDataType= "words like this and even numbers like 10"  
# the key words True and False without any quotations are the data type Boolean
booleanTrue= True
booleanFalse= False
# There are also None(in other languages Null) types which are basically the absence of a value
noneType= None
# sometimes "" is also considered null or none but is not truly of the type

# Other data types include lists & dictionaries, discussed in another file and 
# other quite complex data types that have very specific uses.
# The ones listed here are the most commonly seen day to day
